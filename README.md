# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression

Below are the results of the linear regression analysis performed in order to predict MPG with vehicle length, vehicle weight, spoiler angle, ground clearance, and AWD.

Based on our analysis we know the following:

* Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the data set.
* The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero due to the p-value (5.35e-11) being much smaller than our significance level of 0.01, meaning we can reject the null hypothesis.
* Our model effectively predicts the mpg of Mechacar prototypes as evident by our r-squared value of 0.7149. There is a 71.5% chance future data fits into this model.
